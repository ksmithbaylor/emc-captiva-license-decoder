For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = _react2['default'].createClass({\n  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\n  mixins: [_mixinsStylePropable2['default']],\n\n  contextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2['default'].PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  propTypes: {\n    afterElementType: _react2['default'].PropTypes.string,\n    afterStyle: _react2['default'].PropTypes.object,\n    beforeElementType: _react2['default'].PropTypes.string,\n    beforeStyle: _react2['default'].PropTypes.object,\n    children: _react2['default'].PropTypes.node,\n    elementType: _react2['default'].PropTypes.string,\n\n    /**\n     * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n     */\n    style: _react2['default'].PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      beforeElementType: 'div',\n      afterElementType: 'div',\n      elementType: 'div'\n    };\n  },\n\n  //for passing default theme context to children\n  childContextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2['default'].PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  getChildContext: function getChildContext() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.state.muiTheme\n    };\n  },\n\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.context.muiTheme ?
